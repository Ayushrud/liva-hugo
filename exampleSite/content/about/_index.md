Journalism and mass communication graduate from Amity University. Through my journey, I have gained
valuable experience working for non-profit organizations, where I created compelling content and wrote
blogs and articles that garnered significant (10x) social media followers. This has equipped me to engage
audiences, effective communication, and adept to various writing styles across social media platforms.
In my personal time, I passionately write blogs that delve into relevant socio-political scenarios, by which I
stay informed and engage in meaningful conversations. Feel free to write your genuine feedback and share your 
insights.
